# 🚀 Quick Integration Summary

## How to Use This Standardized Actions Repository

You now have a **centralized GitHub Actions repository** that can deploy and manage your FKS, NGINX, and ATS services with consistent patterns.

## 🎯 Quick Start Integration

### For Each Service Repository (FKS/NGINX/ATS):

1. **Copy the integration workflow:**
   ```bash
   # In your service repo (e.g., FKS repo)
   cp actions/examples/service-repo-integration/fks-deploy.yml .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   ```

2. **Your service repo now calls the standardized actions:**
   ```yaml
   # This workflow lives in your FKS/NGINX/ATS repo
   uses: nuniesmith/actions/.github/workflows/deploy-service.yml@main
   ```

3. **Deploy from your service repository:**
   - Go to **Actions** tab in your service repo
   - Run the deployment workflow
   - Choose deployment mode (health-check, update-only, full-deploy)

## 🔄 What Happens When You Deploy

1. **Your service repo** triggers deployment
2. **Standardized actions repo** handles:
   - ✅ Server creation/management on Linode
   - ✅ User setup (root, jordan, actions_user, service_user)
   - ✅ Tailscale VPN connection
   - ✅ Docker Compose deployment
   - ✅ Docker-based monitoring setup
   - ✅ SSL certificates and DNS
   - ✅ Health checks and notifications

3. **Back to service repo** for any custom post-deployment steps

## ✅ Benefits You Get

- **One place to manage:** All deployment logic centralized
- **Consistent deployments:** Same process for all services
- **Easy troubleshooting:** Standardized patterns and logging
- **Security:** Proper user separation and access controls
- **Monitoring:** Docker-based setup included by default
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new services

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test with health-check mode** first for each service
2. **Gradually replace** your existing deployment methods
3. **Add new services** using the same pattern
4. **Customize** post-deployment steps as needed

All your secrets and configurations are already set up in the standardized repository - just copy the integration workflows and start deploying!
