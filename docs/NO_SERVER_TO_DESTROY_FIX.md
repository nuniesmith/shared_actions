# No Server to Destroy Fix

## Issue
The nginx deployment workflow is failing at the "Destroy Existing Server" step because:
1. The workflow is configured with `overwrite_server: true` 
2. This triggers the destroy step even when no server exists
3. The destroy step was not gracefully handling the "no server found" case

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Destroy Server Logic
Updated the destroy step to properly handle cases where no server exists:

```bash
if [[ -n "$EXISTING_SERVER" ]]; then
  # Server exists - destroy it
  echo "üî• Destroying server: $SERVER_LABEL (ID: $SERVER_ID)"
  linode-cli linodes delete "$SERVER_ID"
  echo "‚úÖ Server destroyed successfully"
else
  # No server found - continue gracefully
  echo "‚ÑπÔ∏è No existing ${{ env.SERVICE_NAME }} server found to destroy"
  echo "‚úÖ Proceeding with fresh deployment"
fi
```

### 2. Cleaned Up Duplicate Code
Removed orphaned code blocks that were causing parsing issues in the Tailscale cleanup section.

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
The workflow now:
- Gracefully handles "no server to destroy" scenarios
- Provides clear logging about what's happening
- Continues with deployment when no server exists
- Only performs Tailscale cleanup when there was actually a server

## Expected Behavior
When `overwrite_server: true` is set:
1. If server exists ‚Üí destroy it, then create new one
2. If no server exists ‚Üí skip destroy, proceed to create new one
3. Both cases should result in successful deployment

## Test Status
- ‚úÖ Syntax validation passed
- ‚úÖ Graceful "no server" handling implemented
- ‚úÖ Duplicate code removed
- ‚è≥ Ready for deployment test

The deployment should now proceed successfully even when there's no existing server to destroy.
