# FKS Multi-Server DNS Update Configuration

## Overview
Added automatic DNS record updates to the FKS multi-server deployment workflow to properly map subdomains to the correct servers.

## DNS Mapping Strategy

### üîê Auth Server (fks-auth)
- `auth.7gram.xyz` ‚Üí Auth Server IP
- Handles: Authentication, SSO, user management

### ‚ö° API Server (fks-api) 
- `api.7gram.xyz` ‚Üí API Server IP
- `data.7gram.xyz` ‚Üí API Server IP
- `worker.7gram.xyz` ‚Üí API Server IP
- Handles: REST API, data processing, background workers

### üåê Web Server (fks-web)
- `fkstrading.xyz` ‚Üí Web Server IP (primary domain)
- `www.7gram.xyz` ‚Üí Web Server IP
- Handles: React frontend on port 3000, nginx reverse proxy

### üîÄ Nginx Routing (via Web Server)
- `admin.7gram.xyz` ‚Üí Web Server IP (nginx will route internally)
- `monitor.7gram.xyz` ‚Üí Web Server IP (nginx will route internally)  
- `nodes.7gram.xyz` ‚Üí Web Server IP (nginx will route internally)

## What Was Added

### 1. DNS Update Step
Added a new step `üåê Update DNS Records for Multi-Server Deployment` that:
- Checks out the actions repository to access the DNS updater script
- Gets the server IPs from each deployment job
- Updates Cloudflare DNS records using the Cloudflare API
- Maps each subdomain to the appropriate server

### 2. Custom DNS Logic
Instead of using the generic DNS script, implemented custom logic for FKS:
- Direct API calls to Cloudflare for precise control
- Proper mapping based on service architecture
- Error handling and fallbacks

### 3. Enhanced Deployment Summary
Updated the summary to show:
- Which DNS records were updated
- The mapping of subdomains to server IPs
- Clear indication of service endpoints

## How It Works

1. **After Deployment**: Once all three servers are deployed successfully
2. **DNS Checkout**: The workflow checks out the actions repository 
3. **IP Collection**: Collects Tailscale IPs from each deployment job output
4. **DNS Updates**: Makes API calls to Cloudflare to update each record
5. **Verification**: Shows the updated DNS mapping in the deployment summary

## Required Secrets
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API token
- `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`: The zone ID for 7gram.xyz domain

## Result
After deployment, your DNS will properly route:
- Authentication requests to the auth server
- API/data requests to the API server  
- Web traffic to the web server (which runs nginx + React)
- Admin/monitoring requests to nginx for internal routing

The old issue where all subdomains pointed to `100.89.118.108` will be resolved, and each service will get traffic routed to the correct server!
