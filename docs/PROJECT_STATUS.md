- **Health Checks**: Service-specific health validation
- **Cloud Dashboards**: Optional Netdata Cloud integration
- **Discord Notifications**: Deployment status alerts

### 🚀 Multi-Service Support
- **Service Isolation**: Each service runs under dedicated user
- **Resource Management**: Configurable server types per service
- **Deployment Modes**: Full deploy, update-only, health-check
- **Rollback Support**: Safe deployment with recovery options

## 🎨 Architecture Highlights

### User Management Strategy ✅
```
root                    # System admin (emergency access)
├── jordan             # Personal admin (sudo + docker)
├── actions_user       # GitHub Actions (sudo + docker)  
└── {service}_user     # Service account (docker only)
```

### Deployment Flow ✅
```
GitHub Actions → Linode Server → Tailscale VPN → Service Deployment
     ↓               ↓              ↓              ↓
Secret Validation → User Creation → VPN Setup → Docker Deploy → Health Check
```

### Monitoring Stack ✅
```
Service Containers → Netdata Agent → Cloud Dashboard → Discord Alerts
                                  ↓
                             Local Dashboard (via Tailscale)
```

## 🔧 Current Implementation Status

### Working Solutions Based on Your Analysis:

#### ✅ NGINX (Working Great)
- Server setup and Tailscale connection: **PERFECT**
- SSL and domain configuration: **WORKING**  
- Netdata connection: **WORKING**
- Issue: Docker Compose not starting after deployment

#### ⚠️ FKS (Mostly Working, Multi-Server Issues)
- Single server deployment: **WORKING**
- Multi-server setup: **FAILING** 
- Netdata integration: **WORKING**
- Recommendation: Use NGINX deployment logic as template

#### ✅ ATS (Working Well)
- Server deployment: **WORKING**
- Tailscale and Netdata: **WORKING**
- Game server integration: **STABLE**

## 🛠️ Next Steps & Recommendations

### 1. 🔧 Fix Multi-Server Logic (Priority: HIGH)
```bash
# Use the working NGINX deployment pattern for multi-server setups
# Focus on the server creation and user management flow from NGINX
```

### 2. 🐳 Docker Compose Startup Issue (Priority: HIGH)  
```bash
# Debug why Docker Compose shows "started" but containers aren't running
# Check service dependencies and environment variable passing
```

### 3. 🚀 Test & Validate (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Test FKS deployment with NGINX-based logic
- Validate all service types work with standardized approach
- Test destruction workflows thoroughly

### 4. 📋 Service-Specific Fixes (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Fix FKS multi-container startup sequence
- Optimize ATS game server resource usage
- Enhance NGINX routing configuration

## 🎉 What You Can Do Now

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Deploy NGINX**: Use as reference for other services
   ```bash
   gh workflow run deploy-service.yml -f service_name=nginx -f deployment_mode=full-deploy
   ```

2. **Test User Management**: Validate user creation and SSH access
   ```bash
   ./scripts/users/user-manager.sh create-all --service test-service
   ```

3. **Setup Monitoring**: Configure Netdata for existing services
   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitoring/netdata-setup.sh your-service --claim-token YOUR_TOKEN
   ```

### Integration Path:
1. **Replace Individual Repos**: Use this standardized repo for all deployments
2. **Migrate Secrets**: Run `./scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh` for each service
3. **Test Deployments**: Start with update-only mode for existing services
4. **Full Migration**: Switch to standardized workflows entirely
