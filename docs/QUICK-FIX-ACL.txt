ðŸ”§ Quick Fix for Tailscale ACL Tag Permission Error
=================================================

PROBLEM: Your OAuth client can't use "tag:ci" because it's not defined in your ACL.

SOLUTION: Add the tagOwners section to your Tailscale ACL.

STEPS:
1. Go to: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls
2. Find this section in your ACL (it's currently commented out):

   // "tagOwners": {
   //  	"tag:example": ["autogroup:admin"],
   // },

3. Replace it with this (uncommented):

   "tagOwners": {
   	"tag:ci": ["autogroup:admin"]
   },

4. Save your ACL changes
5. Retry your GitHub Actions deployment

MINIMAL CHANGE NEEDED:
Just uncomment the tagOwners section and change "tag:example" to "tag:ci".

Your deployment will work immediately after this ACL update! ðŸš€

NOTE: Since you have {"src": ["*"], "dst": ["*"], "ip": ["*"]} in your grants,
the tag:ci devices will have full access, which is what you want for CI/CD.
